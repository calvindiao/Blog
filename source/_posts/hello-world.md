## HELLO WORLD

Finally, I’ve set up my blog and mounted it on an `Aliyun` server.

Thinking back, three days ago, I didn’t even know what Aliyun was.

Well, at least I reinstalled the system about 15 times. The online tutorials for setting up a `Hexo` blog all had some issues, particularly with `GIT hooks` and `nginx` configuration. I also stumbled into countless pitfalls before truly understanding how it all works. But the moment I saw the IP address light up, it was all worth it.

Let’s just consider these past three days as an introduction to Linux systems (~~since I’ll have to learn it sooner or later~~).

From now on, I’ll use this platform to share my project experiences and personal journey.

Keep it up!
DCH
