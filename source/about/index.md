## Hello World

Hey, guys! Welcome to Nerdy Café. 

This is a peaceful place where we can explore all sorts of interesting things together. I earned my bachelor’s degree with **honors** from a prestigious honors department, Changwang, @NUIST from 2018 to 2022. Since 2024, I’ve been a graduate student in Computing and Software @McMaster.

I love watching movies (I even built a Home Theater for my collection), working out (jogging, hitting the gym), and spending time with my cat. Speaking of which, I have a cute British Shorthair named Tandy. He’s a bit aloof and prefers watching me code from a high cabinet.

My life’s goal is to investigate and explore tech innovations, and I’m committed to it, no matter how challenging the journey might be.

I’m glad you’re here spending your time at Nerdy Café. Feel free to email me anytime at calvindiao@gmail.com. *^O^*
