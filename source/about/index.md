Hey, guys! Welcome to Nerdy Caf√© ‚òïÔ∏è

This is a place where we can explore all sorts of interesting memories of my life. 

I earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree with **honors** from a prestigious honors department, **Changwang @NUIST** from 2018 to 2022. Since 2024, I‚Äôve been a M.Eng student in **Computing and Software @McMaster**.

I love watching movies (I even built a Home Theater at home), working out (jogging, hitting the gym), and spending time with my cat, Tandy. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here spending your time at Nerdy Caf√©. Feel free to email me anytime at diaochenhao@gmail.com. ü§©
